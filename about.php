			      <p>Hello! This is a portfolio of my work as a painter, photographer, mother, and wife.  I hope to have a career as a web developer.</p>
			      <p>I achieved a BA in psychology and art from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio in 2006.  I then completed a MA degree in Graphic Communication from the University of Wolverhampton in 2007 in England.  I worked for a year in England as an applications engineer for a company called Minivator, and as a web designer for a company called IT Futures.  In 2008, I moved back to the United States, and could not find similar work.  After starting a wonderful family, I found Code Louisville and I am back on track with my desired career.</p>
